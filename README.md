# DySi_Select

This repository contains the implementation of the thesis "Dynamic Situation-based selection of relevant sensor data" (MT3532). The repository is divided into individual modules. This module provides the necessary scripts for running the simulation on CARLA, as well as the script for verifying real-world portability. The dataset for training will be updated soon. 
More description is available in the folders inside.
